0,"What does the ""yield"" keyword do?","What is the use of the yield keyword in Python? What does it do? For example, I'm trying to understand this code1: def _get_child_candidates(self, distance, min_dist, max_dist): if self._leftchild ...",It's not only about the technical finesse on here but rather who was first sometimes. Which isn't a bad thing :)
1,"What does if __name__ == ""__main__"": do?","What does this do? if __name__ == ""__main__"": print(""Hello world!"")","Just for the record - what is ""main"": docs.python.org/3/reference/… and what is ""name"": docs.python.org/3/reference/…"
2,Does Python have a ternary conditional operator?,"If Python doesn't have a ternary conditional operator, is it possible to use other language constructs to simulate one?","In the Python 3.0 official documentation referenced in a comment above, this is referred to as ""conditional_expressions"" and is very cryptically defined. That documentation doesn't even include the term ""ternary"", so you would be hard-pressed to find it via Google unless you knew exactly what to look for. The version 2 documentation is somewhat more helpful and includes a link to ""PEP 308"", which includes a lot of interesting historical context related to this question."
3,What are metaclasses in Python?,"In Python, what are metaclasses and what do we use them for?",It appears that in Django models.Model it does not use __metaclass__ but rather class Model(metaclass=ModelBase): to reference a ModelBase class which then does the aforementioned metaclass magic. Great post! Here's the Django source: github.com/django/django/blob/master/django/db/models/…
4,How do I check whether a file exists without exceptions?,"How do I check whether a file exists or not, without using the try statement?","To check whether a Path object exists independently of whether is it a file or directory, use my_path.exists()."
5,How do I merge two dictionaries in a single expression (take union of dictionaries)?,"I want to merge two dictionaries into a new dictionary. x = {'a': 1, 'b': 2} y = {'b': 10, 'c': 11} z = merge(x, y) >>> z {'a': 1, 'b': 10, 'c': 11} Using x.update(y) modifies x in-place ...","@MohammadAzim ""strings only"" only applies to keyword argument expansion in callables, not generalized unpacking syntax. To demonstrate that this works: {**{(0, 1):2}} -> {(0, 1): 2}"
6,How do I execute a program or call a system command?,How do I call an external command within Python as if I'd typed it in a shell or command prompt?,"I don't get it, what is wrong with import os; os.system('pip list | grep anatome')? At least that allows you to do piping as my example shows. It's not clear how to do that with import subprocess; subprocess.run([""ls"", ""-l""])."
7,How can I safely create a nested directory?,"What is the most elegant way to check if the directory a file is going to be written to exists, and if not, create the directory using Python? Here is what I tried: import os file_path = ""/my/...","In general you might need to account for the case where there's no directory in the filename. On my machine dirname('foo.txt') gives '', which doesn't exist and causes makedirs() to fail."
8,Accessing the index in 'for' loops,"How do I access the index in a for loop? xs = [8, 23, 45] for x in xs: print(""item #{} = {}"".format(index, x)) Desired output: item #1 = 8 item #2 = 23 item #3 = 45","Note that indexes in python start from 0, so the indexes for your example list are 0 to 4 not 1 to 5"
9,How to make a flat list out of a list of lists?,"I want to flatten this list of lists: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7], [8, 9]] into: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]","There's an in-depth discussion of this here: rightfootin.blogspot.com/2006/09/more-on-python-flatten.html, discussing several methods of flattening arbitrarily nested lists of lists. An interesting read!"
10,Difference between @staticmethod and @classmethod,What is the difference between a function decorated with @staticmethod and one decorated with @classmethod?,"static methods are sometimes better off as module level functions in python for the sake of cleanliness. With a module function it is easier to import just the function you need and prevent unnecessary ""."" syntax (I'm looking at you Objective-C). class methods have more use since they can be used in combination with polymorphism to create ""factory pattern"" functions. this is because class methods receive the class as an implicit parameter."
11,Understanding slicing,I need a good explanation (references are a plus) on Python slicing.,"Slicing builtin types returns a copy but that's not universal. Notably, slicing NumPy arrays returns a view that shares memory with the original."
12,Finding the index of an item in a list,"Given a list [""foo"", ""bar"", ""baz""] and an item in the list ""bar"", how do I get its index 1?","Are you returning: [1] The lowest index in case there are multiple instances of ""bar"", [2] All the indices of ""bar""?"
13,Iterating over dictionaries using 'for' loops,"d = {'x': 1, 'y': 2, 'z': 3} for key in d: print(key, 'corresponds to', d[key]) How does Python recognize that it needs only to read the key from the dictionary? Is key a special keyword, or is ...","As we know that in Python Dictionary as a set of key: value pairs, with the requirement that the keys are unique (within one dictionary). A pair of braces creates an empty dictionary: {}. Placing a comma-separated list of key:value pairs within the braces adds initial key:value pairs to the dictionary. No, key is not a special word in Python. Here key is Just a variable name."
14,Using global variables in a function,"How can I create or use a global variable in a function? If I create a global variable in one function, how can I use that global variable in another function? Do I need to store the global variable ...","It's extreme exaggeration to refer to globals as ""so dangerous."" Globals are perfectly fine in every language that has ever existed and ever will exist. They have their place. What you should have said is they can cause issues if you have no clue how to program."
15,Does Python have a string 'contains' substring method?,"I'm looking for a string.contains or string.indexof method in Python. I want to do: if not somestring.contains(""blah""): continue","Under the hood, Python will use __contains__(self, item), __iter__(self), and __getitem__(self, key) in that order to determine whether an item lies in a given contains. Implement at least one of those methods to make in available to your custom type."
16,How do I get the current time?,How do I get the current time?,"please note, the most voted answers are for timezonoe-naive datetime, while we see that in production environment more and more services across the world are connected together and timezone-aware datetime become the required standard"

The string field is unique, so that is the key of the dictionary. I can sort on the keys, but how ...","The dictionary data structure does not have inherent order. You can iterate through it but there's nothing to guarantee that the iteration will follow any particular order. This is by design, so your best bet is probaly using anohter data structure for representation."
20,How to iterate over rows in a DataFrame in Pandas,"I have a DataFrame from Pandas: import pandas as pd inp = [{'c1':10, 'c2':100}, {'c1':11,'c2':110}, {'c1':12,'c2':120}] df = pd.DataFrame(inp) print df Output: c1 c2 0 10 100 1 11 110 2 ...","The df.iteritems() iterates over columns and not rows. Thus, to make it iterate over rows, you have to transpose (the ""T""), which means you change rows and columns into each other (reflect over diagonal). As a result, you effectively iterate the original dataframe over its rows when you use df.T.iteritems()"
21,What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__?,What is the difference between __str__ and __repr__ in Python?,"Definitely disagree with your opinion that debugging isn't the way to go. For development use a debugger (and/or logging), for production use logging. With a debugger you have a view of everything that went wrong when the problem occurred. You can see the full picture. Unless you are logging EVERYTHING you can't get that. Plus if you are logging everything you're going have to wade through tons of data to get at what you want."
22,How can I add new keys to a dictionary?,How do I add a key to an existing dictionary? It doesn't have an .add() method.,"Either use the accepted answer: d['mynewkey'] = 'mynewvalue' or you could use val = d.setdefault('mynewkey', 'mynewvalue')"

25,How do I concatenate two lists in Python?,"How do I concatenate two lists in Python? Example: listone = [1, 2, 3] listtwo = [4, 5, 6] Expected outcome: >>> joinedlist [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]","Do you want to simply append, or do you want to merge the two lists in sorted order? What output do you expect for [1,3,6] and [2,4,5]? Can we assume both sublists are already sorted (as in your example)?"
26,How do I check if a list is empty?,"For example, if passed the following: a = [] How do I check to see if a is empty?","Playing devil's advocate. I don't understand why this idiom is considered pythonic. 'Explicit is better then implicit', correct? This check doesn't seem very explicit about what is is checking."

30,How do I pass a variable by reference?,Are parameters are passed by reference or value? How do I pass by reference so that the code below outputs 'Changed' instead of 'Original'? class PassByReference: def __init__(self): self....,"For a short explanation/clarification see the first answer to this stackoverflow question. As strings are immutable, they won't be changed and a new variable will be created, thus the ""outer"" variable still has the same value."

32,How do I clone a list so that it doesn't change unexpectedly after assignment?,"While using new_list = my_list, any modifications to new_list changes my_list every time. Why is this, and how can I clone or copy the list to prevent it?",new_list = my_list just assigns the name new_list to the object my_list refers to.
33,How to make function decorators and chain them together?,"How can I make two decorators in Python that would do the following? @makebold @makeitalic def say(): return ""Hello"" ...which should return: ""<b><i>Hello</i></b&...","""You cannot un-decorate a function."" - While normally true, it is possible to reach inside the closure in the function return by a decorator (i.e. via its __closure__ attribute) to pull out the original undecorated function. One example usage is documented in this answer which covers how it is possible to inject a decorator function in a lower level in limited circumstances."
34,Understanding Python super() with __init__() methods [duplicate],"Why is super() used? Is there a difference between using Base.__init__ and super().__init__? class Base(object): def __init__(self): print ""Base created"" class ChildA(...",this is a very simple intro to classes worth going through: realpython.com/python-super/….

""31"" → 31","As a general rule, if you have an object in Python, and want to convert to that type of object, call type(my_object) on it. The result can usually be called as a function to do the conversion. For instance type(100) results in int, so you can call int(my_object) to try convert my_object to an integer. This doesn't always work, but is a good ""first guess"" when coding."
49,How do I get the last element of a list?,How do I get the last element of a list?,"Downvoted because I feel the core of this answer is incorrect. Getting a list when you want an element only postpones the inevitable ""list index out of range"" - and that's what should happen when attempting to get an element from an empty list. For Strings astr[-1:] could be a valid approach since it returns the same type as astr[-1], but I don't think the ':' helps to deal with empty lists (and the question is about lists). If the idea is to use ""alist[-1:]"" as a conditional instead of ""len(alist) > 0"", I think it's much more readable to use the later. (happy to upvote if I missed something)"

56,Static class variables and methods in Python,How do I create static class variables or methods in Python?,"Yes. The absence of the keyword ""static"" might be misleading, but any object initialised inside the class (just one indent inside the class, and not in the constructor) is static. It is not dependent on instantiation (because it is not part of the constructor). As for methods, you can do that with an @staticmethod decorator."

I want to read the file line by line and append each line to the end of the list.,"I checked the memory profile of different ways given in the answers using the procedure mentioned here. The memory usage is far better when each line is read from the file and processed, as suggested by @DevShark here. Holding all lines in a collection object is not a good idea if memory is a constraint or the file is large. The execution time is similar in both the approaches."
